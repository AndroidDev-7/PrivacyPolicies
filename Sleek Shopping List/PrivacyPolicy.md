Our Sleek Shopping App respects your privacy and is committed to ensuring the protection of your personal information. Please read the following to understand how we handle your data:

Storage: The app stores items on your device using AsyncStorage. It doesnâ€™t require explicit storage permissions as it utilizes AsyncStorage for data storage.

Approximate Location: The app may determine an approximate location based on IP addresses using ipinfo. This is solely for enhancing user experience and is not used to track or identify individual users.

Permissions: Our app does not require any specific permissions (such as location or storage) to operate. We believe in minimizing the collection of data and respecting your device permissions.

Data Collection: Sleek Shopping App does not collect any user data or personally identifiable information. Your privacy is paramount to us, and we do not engage in collecting, storing, or sharing any personal data from our users.

Please note that while we take all reasonable measures to protect your information, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is entirely secure. Thus, we cannot guarantee absolute security.
